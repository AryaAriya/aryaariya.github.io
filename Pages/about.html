    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="dropcap">
     My name is Arya Aswini, and I'm passionate about creating meaningful, thoughtful, and visually compelling designs. 
    </p>  
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
   <p>I graduated from Sacramento State University, holding a B.S. in Computer Science. Despite holding a degree in Computer Science, I have always been a creative person and more inclined to and preferred creative pursuits and things all my life - the kind that invites imagination, emotion, and storytelling. That pull naturally led me to UI/UX design.</p>
  </section>

   <section class="about-section">
   <p>Although I've taken a few classes, I am a self-taught designer. I've learned much of the processes, concepts, and theories of UI/UX through reading books and blogs, and trying to implement these concepts on my own work one way or another, and refining my understanding one idea at a time.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Work</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not designing, you'll find me exploring films, reading books, delving into history, worldbuilding, writing stories, and sketching ideas in the margins of my notebooks. Creativity doesn't switch off for me - it simply shifts forms.
