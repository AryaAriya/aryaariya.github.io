  <section class="about-section">
   <p>I'm a graduate of Sacramento State University, holding a B.S. in Computer Science. Despite holding a degree in Computer Science, I have always been a creative person and more inclined to and preferred creative pursuits and things, which led to UI/UX design.</p>

   <section class="about-section">
   <p>Despite taking a couple of classes, I am somewhat of a self-taught designer, and have learned much of the processes, concepts, and theories of UI/UX through reading books and blogs and trying to implement these concepts on my own stuff one way or another.</p>
