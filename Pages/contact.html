I’ve always been drawn to the quiet details — the texture of old paper, the elegance of serif
      type, the way stories shape the way we see the world. Design became the place where all of
      those things met. Over the years, I’ve explored visual design, storytelling, and digital
      experiences, always chasing that feeling of creating something that feels lived‑in and loved. <li>Stories behind the work matter</li>
      <li>Design should feel like an experience</li>
      <li>Curiosity is a compass</li>      When I’m not designing, you’ll find me exploring films, collecting small beautiful objects,
      sketching ideas in the margins of notebooks, or wandering through bookstores looking for
      inspiration in unexpected places
